# Implement KMP algorithm for pattern search

## Time Complexity O(N) which best possible time we can get in any pattern serching algorithm

This Function return indext of first element of match pattern elements as output.



### Example 1:
```
Input: RDBMSSURSURAJJPG 
Pattern to search : SURAJ
Output: 9

```
### Example 2:
```
Input: SEROJSHASHESHERSHAH
Pattern to search : SHERSHAH
Output: 12

```
