Input Format

you will be given the size of array n . This will be followed by the elements of the array A0  . . . A n-1.

Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= A <= 10^9,
```
Output Format

You have to print the Maximum Rectangle Area

Sample Input

7
6 2 5 4 5 1 6
```
Sample Output
```
12
```
Explanation
```
Max Area will be 3*4=12 we can take height 4 from 2nd,3rd and 4th bar.
