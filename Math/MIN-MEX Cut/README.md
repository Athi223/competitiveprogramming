A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1.

Let MEX of a binary string be the smallest digit among 0, 1, or 2 that does not occur in the string. For example, MEX of 001011 is 2, because 0 and 1 occur in the string at least once, MEX of 1111 is 0, because 0 and 2 do not occur in the string and 0<2.

A binary string 𝑠 is given. You should cut it into any number of substrings such that each character is in exactly one substring. It is possible to cut the string into a single substring — the whole string.

A string 𝑎 is a substring of a string 𝑏 if 𝑎 can be obtained from 𝑏 by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
