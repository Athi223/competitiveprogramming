# Middle of the Linked List 

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print the second middle element.

# Examples: 

## Example 1: 
 If the given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the output should be 3.

## Example 2: 
If given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the output should be 4.
