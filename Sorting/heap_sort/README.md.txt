# Heap sort is an Sorting algorithm implemented in C language.

## it is mainly seen as improvement of selection sort, used heap Data Structure and improvemnt of Selction sort

#### Time Complexity O(N*logN) which best possible time we can get in any camparism based sorting algorithm

This Function return sorted array of numbers or list of elements as output.

For sort an array user just need to pass an array to HeapSort function
 

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [23,4,251,14,13]
Output: [4,13,14,23,251]
Explanation: There is a given an array with unsorted form and after using heap sort it return sorted array as an output.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1, 31, 55, 1, -4, 2, -9]
Output: [-9, -4, -1, 1, 2, 31, 55]

```
